## Contributing
We will be using the git GUI to save our progress and pass the files inbetween computers at college and at home.
To download the project you must clone the repository using git GUI and then it will automatically create the git folder this git folder will make things work! It is important to download it this way otherwise you wont be able to save the project correctly.

Then to save any changes you need to save all files, close out of unity or any other programs, click Rescan in the Git gui and then click stage changed.
staging the changes basically tells what files will be added to the commit and the commit is the next thing you will have to do.
just enter a commit message with what you added in that update. after making a commit you need to push and this will make all the files that you updated appear on GitHub.
